### Overview

Elements uses two typefaces: Arvo and Open Sans. Arvo should be used for headings, and Open Sans for paragraph. Both fonts have italic variants as well. Icons are from [Zest Icons](https://zesticons.com/).


### Elements

Elements should be typed "ELEMENTS" as a title, and "Elements" when refered to in a paragraph setting. As a title, "ELEMENTS" should use Arvo at normal weight and 95% tracking.

#### Arvo - Normal - Tracking 95%

```type
{
    "headings": [60],
    "color": "#000",
    "font": "Arvo",
    "tracking": 9.5,
    "weight": 300,
    "text": "ELEMENTS"
}
```


### Headlines

Packaging should use Arvo at regular weight, while Headings complimenting paragraph type should use Arvo Bold.

#### Arvo

```type
{
  "headings": [72,60,48,36],
  "font": "Arvo",
  "color": "#000"
}
```

#### Arvo Bold

```type
{
  "headings": [72,60,48,36],
  "font": "Arvo",
  "weight": "600",
  "color": "#000"
}
```


### Paragraphs

Paragraph text should use Open Sans in light or regular weight. Emphasized text may use semi-bold. Light should be used where possible, however, regular should be used in print in order to ensure the readability of the text.

#### Open Sans 300 - Light

```type
{
  "paragraphs": ["16/24"],
  "font": "Open Sans",
  "weight": "300",
  "color": "#000"
}
```

#### Open Sans 400 - Regular

```type
{
  "paragraphs": ["16/24"],
  "font": "Open Sans",
  "weight": "400",
  "color": "#000"
}
```

#### Open Sans 600 - Semi-bold

```type
{
  "paragraphs": ["16/24"],
  "font": "Open Sans",
  "weight": "600",
  "color": "#000"
}
```
