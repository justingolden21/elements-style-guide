"Greatspell" is one word, no hypen, with a capital G and lowercase s. "Elements Deck" is capitalized as well, but "tracker cards" are not. All other terms are lowercase and non-proper nouns. The "Elements Deck" is defined as the 80 card spell deck and does not include Greatspells or tracker cards.

The four elements are "fire", "water", "gem", and "electric"/"electricity" in that order and in lowercase.

When passed, selected, or described in any context except for casting, the cards are "cards". As they are being cast, they are "spells".
